# Agricultural-Production-and-Cost
This analysis comprised of using four datasets to draw meaningful insights into the agricultural sector in India.
So for this project, i had to generate results for some KPI's.

# The KPI's include

## Average Annual Growth Rate (AAGR) of Foodgrains Production:

* Calculate the AAGR for total foodgrains production over the years to assess the average annual growth rate.

## Seasonal Yield Variation:

* Analyze the seasonal variation in foodgrains production by calculating the percentage change between Kharif and Rabi seasons.

## Crop-wise Production Trends:

* Evaluate the production trends for specific foodgrains (e.g., rice, wheat) to identify which crops have shown significant changes in production over the years.

## Correlation between Weather Variables and Foodgrains Production:

* Investigate the correlation between production levels and key weather variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation) to understand the impact of weather on agricultural output.


## Cost of Cultivation Analysis:

* Compare the A2+FL and C2 components of the cost of cultivation to assess the financial burden on farmers and identify areas for cost optimization.

## Yield-Cost Relationship:

* Use regression analysis to determine the relationship between the cost of cultivation and crop yield, helping farmers optimize input usage for higher returns.

## Regional Cost Disparities:

* Analyze regional variations in the cost of cultivation and yield to identify areas with higher production efficiency or challenges that need attention.

## Cost of Production per Quintal Analysis:

* Calculate and analyze the cost of production per quintal for different crops to identify crops with higher or lower profitability.


## Oilseeds Yield Analysis:

* Investigate the yield indices for different oilseeds (Groundnut, Sesamum, Rapeseed & Mustard, etc.) to identify trends and variations.
